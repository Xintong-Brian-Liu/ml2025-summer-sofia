# Assignment #4.2: GitHub and Python Introduction

## Overview
This assignment introduces basic Python programming concepts and GitHub repository management. You'll create a simple Python program that demonstrates user input handling and array operations.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account (create one at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one)

## Tasks

### 1. Repository Setup
- Create a new **public** repository named `ml2025-summer-sofia` on GitHub

### 2. Python Program Development
Create a Python program (`module4.py`) that implements the following functionality:

#### Program Requirements:
1. **Input N**: Prompt the user to enter a positive integer N
2. **Input Numbers**: Ask the user to provide N numbers one by one
3. **Input X**: Ask the user to enter an integer X
4. **Output**: 
   - Return `-1` if X is not found among the N numbers
   - Return the **1-based index** of X if it exists in the previously entered numbers

#### Technical Notes:
- Use the `input()` function for all user input
- Handle the numbers as a sequence (array/list)
- Index counting starts from 1 (not 0)

### 3. File Submission
- Name your Python file `module4.py`
- Upload it to your `ml2025-summer-sofia` repository

## Example Usage
```
Enter a positive integer N: 3
Enter number 1: 10
Enter number 2: 20
Enter number 3: 30
Enter integer X to search: 20
Output: 2
```
